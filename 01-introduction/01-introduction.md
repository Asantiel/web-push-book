# Introduction

This book is for anyone looking to learn about adding push notifications into
their web site / web app.

I started working on push since the early days of Chrome's support and been
following the changes and growth overtime. There have been quite a few changes
since it's early release, but the API's have reached a good point of stability
across browsers.

If there are any changes I'll update this book and push out another release.
To keep up to date please checkout the release page^[https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/releases] / feed^[https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/releases.atom].

On the topics of releases, if, or rather when, you spot a typo, errors or
you have feedback / questions please feel free to open an issue on Github
where this book is hosted^[https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/issues].

On with the book....
