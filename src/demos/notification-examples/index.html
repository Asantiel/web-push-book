    <h1>Notification Examples</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>This page contains a set of example notifications that you can interact
    with to see what is possible with notifications.</p>

    <p>Clicking on the buttons below will show one notification to
    demonstrate a particular options in the notification API.</p>

    <p>If you just want to see what a notification looks like in your browser
    with all the UI options set, click the 'All the Options' button.</p>

    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-overview" disabled>All the Options</button>
    </p>

    <p>The buttons will be enabled if the browser has support for the feature.
    If the button is grey, then it's not supported on your browser.</p>

    <h3>Desktop &amp; Mobile</h3>

    <h6>Title &amp; Body</h6>
    <p>Basic example of a notification with a basic title and body.</p>
    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-title-body" disabled>Title &amp; Body</button>
      <button class="js-notification-long-title-body" disabled>Long Title &amp; Body</button>
    </p>

    <h6>Notification Icon</h6>
    <p>The icon on a notification is the image on the left of the title and
    body. This is normally an image relevant to the tweet being sent.</p>
    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-icon" disabled>Icon</button>
    </p>

    <h6>Notification Image</h6>
    <p>Setting an image means the notification can display a large image
    in with the notification. At the time of writing this is behind the
    experimental web platform features in Chrome and the results vary between
    Android and Desktop.</p>
    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-image" disabled>Image</button>
    </p>

    <h6>Action Buttons</h6>
    <p>If you want to offer multiple actions to your user from the notification
    then you can define "actions", which add buttons to the notification that
    you can respond to.</p>
    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-actions" disabled>Actions</button>
    </p>

    <h6>Language Direction</h6>
    <p>You can set a "dir" option to indicate if the test should be displayed
    "left-to-right" or "right-to-left".</p>
    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-dir-ltr" disabled>Direction: LTR</button>
      <button class="js-notification-dir-rtl" disabled>Direction: RTL</button>
    </p>

    <h6>Tag</h6>
    <p>Defining a tag for a notification means that when a new Notification
    is shown with the same tag, any old notifications with that tag are
    removed before the new notification is shown.</p>
    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-tag" disabled>Tag</button>
    </p>

    <h6>Renotify</h6>
    <p>When you use the tag option, the default behavior of a new notification
    replacing an existing one is that there is no sound, vibration and the
    screen is kept asleep.</p>
    <p>Renotify is an option that will play a sound, vibrate the device and
    wake up the users device when a tagged notification is replaced. This means
    replacing notifications is the same behavior as a completely new
    notification.</p>
    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-renotify" disabled>Renotify</button>
    </p>

    <h6>Silent</h6>
    <p>When a new notification arrives, it plays a sound, vibrates the users
    device and wakes up the screen. Setting the silent option means that
    the notification is displayed, but there is none of the default behaviors
    like sound, vibration and screen wake.</p>
    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-silent" disabled>Silent</button>
    </p>

    <h6>Require Interaction</h6>
    <p>On desktop a notification is only displayed for a short period of time,
    whereas Android devices will show the notification until the user
    does something with it.</p>
    <p>To get the same behaviour on desktop and mobile you can set the
    "require-interaction" option to true.</p>
    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-require-interaction" disabled>Require Interaction</button>
    </p>

    <h6>Timestamp</h6>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-timestamp" disabled>Timestamp</button>
    </p>


    <h3>Mobile Only</h3>

    <p>These fields aren't <i>strictly</i> mobile only. A desktop browser
    <i>could</i> use these fields if it want to, but at the moment
    they don't. For this reason, you'll need to use a mobile device to
    see what the options do.</p>

    <h6>Notification Badge</h6>
    <p>Notification badges are only being used on mobile, at least at the time
    of writing. It's used to replace the browser icon that is shown by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-badge" disabled>Badge</button>
    </p>

    <h6>Vibration</h6>
    <p>You can define a pattern of vibrations to make a tune. This only
    applies to mobile devices since laptops tend not to vibrate.</p>
    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-vibrate" disabled>Vibrate</button>
    </p>

    <h3>Not Implemented Anywhere Yet</h3>
    <p>The following options are defined in the spec, but haven't been
    implemented anywhere at the time of writing. If the button is enabled,
    click it and see.</p>

    <h6>Sound</h6>
    <p>The sound option has been defined, but at the time of writing no browser
    has implemented it yet.</p>
    <p>
      <button class="js-notification-sound" disabled>Sound</button>
    </p>
