# Introduction

This book is for anyone looking to learn about push notifications on the web.

I started working on push when Chrome first added support. There have been quite a few changes since then. The API's seem to have stabilised a bit across Chrome and Firefox so it's the perfect time for people to learn about push on the web.

This site covers everything I've learnt and will contain anything new I learn over time.

If you spot mistakes, code errors or simple typos please
[raise issues](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/issues) or
[contribute](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/) on Github where
this [content lives](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/).

I'm pretty certain that areas of the push API will change and as they do
I'll update this book and create another release which you'll be able to
find under [Releases on Github](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/releases),
which also has an [RSS feed](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/releases.atom).

Finally, a massive thank you to [all the contributors](https://web-push-book.gauntface.com/contributors.html)
who have helped with this book.
