# Introduction

This book is for anyone looking to learn about push notifications on the web.

I started working on push since the early days of Chrome's support and have been
following it since. There has been quite a few changes since the
earliest implementations in Chrome, but the API's seem to have reached a
reasonable point of stability across browsers to a point that now is a good
time to jot down the best practices and approaches to implementing push on
the web.

If you spot mistakes, code errors or simple typos please
[raise issues](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/issues) or
[contribute](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/) on Github where
this [content lives](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/).

I'm pretty certain that areas of the push API will change and as they do
I'll update this book and create another release which you'll be able to
find under [Releases on Github](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/releases),
which also has an [RSS feed](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/releases.atom).

Finally, a massive thank you to [all the contributors]()
who have helped with this book.
