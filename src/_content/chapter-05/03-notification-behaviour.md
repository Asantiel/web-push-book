# Notification Behaviour

Some of the options you pass into *showNotification*  alter the bhaviour
rather than the UI, like how multiple notifications should be treated.

Be default, calling `showNotification()` with just visual options will have
the following behaviours:

1. Clicking on a notification does nothing.
1. Each notification is shown, nothing is down in terms of collapsing
notifications.
1. Sound and Vibration may be played (depending on the platform).
1. The notification itself is clickable but nothing else.
1. On some platforms the notification will disappear after a short
period of time.

In this secion we are going to look at how we can alter these behaviours
via the notification options available to use. These are arguably the easiest
behaviours to alter / define. In the following section we'll look at the code
to perform common tasks as well as implement more complex behaviours when
showing a notification or handling interaction.

### Notification Click Event

When a user clicks on a notification the default behaviour is for nothing
to happen, but the common practice is for the notification to close and
perhaps perform some other logic (i.e. open a window or make some API
call that will do some remotely).

To this, we just need to define a 'notificationclick' event listener
that will be called when ever a notification is clicked.

<% include('../../demos/node-server/frontend/service-worker.js', 'simpleNotification') %>

From this we can access the notification via 'event.notification'.

### Actions

Actions allow you to give users another level of interaction with your users
over just clicking the notification.

In the previous section you saw how to define actions when calling
`showNotification()`:

<% include('../../demos/notification-examples/notification-examples.js', 'actionsNotification') %>

The behavior of an action press is up to you, simply listen for the notification
click event (just like above) and check the `event.action` value, which will
contain the 'action' parameter you passed into `showNotification()`.

<% include('../../demos/node-server/frontend/service-worker.js', 'notificationClickEvent') %>

### Tag

The *tag* option is a essentially a String ID that "groups" notifications
together allowing an easy way to determine how multiple notifications
are displayed to the user. This is easiest to explain with an example.

Let's display a notification and give it a tag, a string ID, of
'message-group-1'.

<% include('../../demos/notification-examples/notification-examples.js', 'tagNotificationOne') %>

This will show our first notification.

![First notification with tag of message group 1.](/images/notification-screenshots/desktop/chrome-first-tag.png){: .center-image }

If we then display a second notification with a tag of 'message-group-2', we'll
get a second notification.

<% include('../../demos/notification-examples/notification-examples.js', 'tagNotificationTwo') %>

Here's our two notifications.

![Two notifications where the second tag is message group 2.](/images/notification-screenshots/desktop/chrome-second-tag.png){: .center-image }

Now if we show a new notification with a tag of 'message-group-1', the first
notification we displayed will go away and get replaced with this new, third
notification.

<% include('../../demos/notification-examples/notification-examples.js', 'tagNotificationThree') %>

Now we have 2 notifications even though we displayed called show 3
notifications.

![Two notifications where the first notification is replaced by a third notification.](/images/notification-screenshots/desktop/chrome-third-tag.png){: .center-image }

A subtlety to the notification tag is that by default the browser will replace
a notification with a new notification without the same sound and vibration
that you would get with the first notification. This is where `renotify` comes
in.

### Renotify

This largely applies to just mobile devices, making new notifications vibrate
and play a system sound.

There are scenarios where you might want a replacing notification to notify
the user, chat applications for example. In this case you just need to
set `renotify` to true.

<% include('../../demos/notification-examples/notification-examples.js', 'renotifyNotification') %>

Plesae note that renotify is **only used** when a notification is replacing
another notification due to matching tags.

If you set `renotify: true` on a notification without a tag, you'll get the
following error:

    TypeError: Failed to execute 'showNotification' on 'ServiceWorkerRegistration': Notifications which set the renotify flag must specify a non-empty tag

### Silent

This option allows you to show a new notification but prevent the default
behavior of device vibration, sound and turning on a devices display.

This is ideal if your notification doesn't require immediate attention
from the user.

<% include('../../demos/notification-examples/notification-examples.js', 'silentNotification') %>

**Note:** If you define both *silent* and *renotify*, silent will take precedence.

### Requires Interaction

Most noticable on desktop is the time period in which a notification is
displayed before it's hidden. On Android the notifications are displayed until
the user interacts with it.

If your notification requires interaction from the user than you can define
the `requireInteraction` option. This will show the notification permanently
until the user dismisses your notification.

<% include('../../demos/notification-examples/notification-examples.js', 'requireInteraction') %>

The important thing to consider when using this option is if you really have
to use it, showing a notification and forcing the user to stop what they are
doing can be pretty frustrating.
