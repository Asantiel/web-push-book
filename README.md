# push-book

A book on implementing push notifications in a web site / web app (Whatever
you want to call it).

This is in extremely early stages (i.e. me just dumping down thoughts without
proof reading or much focus), so if you spot or have feedback please raise
an issue (or better yet, a pull request) and I'll do my best to address it
when I can.

Cheers,
Matt
